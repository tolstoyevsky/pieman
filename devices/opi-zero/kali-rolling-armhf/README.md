Kali Linux is a security-focused Debian-based distribution with pre-installed tools for penetration testing.
It is maintained by Offensive Security Ltd. `opi-zero/kali-rolling-armhf` allows building custom 32-bit Kali Linux images for [OrangePi Zero](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizero/).

## What's in the distribution?

Kali Linux is a rolling release distribution, so it's pointless to list the packages with their versions here since the versions may change every day.
