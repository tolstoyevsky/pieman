Pieman is a script for creating custom OS images for single-board computers such as Raspberry Pi. The images are based on Debian GNU/Linux and its derivatives at this time. The authors of Pieman were inspired by the project named [rpi23-gen-image](https://github.com/drtyhlpr/rpi23-gen-image). The main reason why it was decided to create a new project instead of improving the existing one is that rpi23-gen-image is intended for creating images only for Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 based on Debian GNU/Linux. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a way to be extended to support different operating systems and single-board computers. Improving the situation would require significant efforts to rework the codebase of the project.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* debootstrap
* dosfstools
* dpkg
* GNU Parted
* GnuPG
* mkpasswd
* Python 3
* PyYAML
* rsync
* Setuptools
* uuidgen
* User mode emulation binaries such as `/usr/bin/qemu-arm-static` and `/usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static`
* wget

### Supported platforms

Theoretically, Pieman can be run on any GNU/Linux, however, it was very carefully tested only on:
* Debian 9 «Stretch»
* Fedora 26
* Ubuntu 16.04 «Xenial Xerus»

### Installation

#### Docker

First, get the latest Pieman Docker image from Docker Hub.

```
$ docker pull cusdeb/pieman
```

Then, get `docker-pieman.sh`

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolstoyevsky/pieman/master/docker-pieman.sh -O docker-pieman.sh
```

or using `curl`

```
$ curl -o docker-pieman.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolstoyevsky/pieman/master/docker-pieman.sh
```

Note, that the script requires bash 4 or higher, so macOS users should upgrade their bash if they haven't done it yet.

##### Usage

Simply run `docker-pieman.sh` to create an image based on Raspbian Stretch for Raspberry Pi 3.

```
$ chmod +x docker-pieman.sh
$ ./docker-pieman.sh
```

Under the hood the script runs

```
$ docker run --privileged --rm -v $(pwd):/result -v /dev:/dev cusdeb/pieman
```

It's quite wordy, isn't it? `docker-pieman.sh` is intended to hide the details and provide an easy-to-use command-line interface.

Another example shows how to create an image based on Ubuntu Xenial for Raspberry Pi 2 with [htop](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/htop) and [mc](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/mc) pre-installed

```
$ ./docker-pieman.sh -e DEVICE=rpi-2-b -e OS=ubuntu-xenial-armhf -e INCLUDES=htop,mc
```

The built images will be located in the current directory. By the way, you can specify the name of your project via the `PROJECT_NAME` environment variable. You can find details on `DEVICE`, `INCLUDES`, `OS`, `PROJECT_NAME` and other environment variables (called parameters) which help customizing images in the Documentation section.

#### Manual

First, clone the Pieman git repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tolstoyevsky/pieman.git
```

Then, go into the newly created directory and clone the debootstrap git repo there. Pieman requires debootstrap `1.0.91 `or higher.

```
$ cd pieman
$ git clone https://anonscm.debian.org/git/d-i/debootstrap.git
$ cd debootstrap
$ git checkout 1.0.91
```

If your distribution has debootstrap 1.0.91 or higher (for example, Ubuntu 17.10), you can skip this step and install it via a package manager.

Next, install the rest of the Pieman dependencies.

On Debian or Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo apt-get install dosfstools gnupg parted python3-setuptools python3-yaml qemu-user-static rsync uuid-runtime wget whois
```

On Fedora:

```
$ sudo dnf install dosfstools dpkg expect gpg parted python3-PyYAML python3-setuptools qemu-user-static rsync wget
```

Finally, return to the project directory and run

```
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

to install the required utilities and modules written in Python.

##### Usage

Go to the project directory and execute the following command to create an image based on Raspbian Stretch for Raspberry Pi 3:

```
$ sudo ./pieman.sh
```

To create an image based on Ubuntu Xenial for Raspberry Pi 2 with [htop](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/htop) and [mc](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/mc) pre-installed run

```
$ sudo env DEVICE=rpi-2-b OS=ubuntu-xenial-armhf INCLUDES=htop,mc ./pieman.sh
```

The built images will be located in `build/<project name>`. By the way, you can specify the name of your project via the `PROJECT_NAME` environment variable. You can find details on `DEVICE`, `INCLUDES`, `OS`, `PROJECT_NAME` and other environment variables (called parameters) which help customizing images in the Documentation section.
